# BudgetBuilder

This is a budget calculator that allows a user to keep track of sources of income versus expenses.
It was created as practice for the udemy course: "The Complete Javascript Course 2020" and adapted as part of an exercise.
Original github repository:
https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course

## Getting Started

The application is composed of simple HTML and CSS files, while the heavy lifting occurs within the Javascript file. No installation is required beyond these basic files and an IDE.

## Running tests

There is a simple test function that can be used by calling the budgetController.testing function from within the console command prompt. This can be used to create test objects as incomes or expenses, for example:

```
budgetController.testing(1)
```
Will create an object in the terminal with new type, value, and percentage properties.

## Deployment

From the appropriate folder, opening the HTML file in a broswer window will link to the necessary JS and CSS assets.


## Built With

* [Google APIs] (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:100,300,400,600) for the fonts
* [Ionic Framework] (http://code.ionicframework.com/ionicons/2.0.1/css/ionicons.min.css) for the icons used

Otherwise, the goals was to use as much Javascript as possible with as little else.
